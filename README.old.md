# FRONT-END CODING CHALLENGE

## THe Challenge

Prototype the following project:

GitHub Followers

Create a service that allows for a user to search for a GitHub username. On a successful search return, display the user's GitHub handle, follower count, and a list of the user's followers (just the avatar is fine). Since some users (e.g. mrdoob, holman, etc.) have many thousands of followers, GitHub only returns a portion of the followers with each request. Create a "load more" button that, when clicked, fetches the next payload of followers. This button should persist until there are no more pages of followers to fetch.

Information on the GitHub API is available here: [GitHub API](https://developer.github.com/v4/)

The UX/UI is totally up to you. If you like, get creative and add additional features a user might find useful!


## Reasoning behind your technical choices, including architectural trade-offs you might have made, anything you left out, or what you might do differently if you were to spend additional time on the project.

## Link to other code you're particularly proud of.

## Link to your resume or public profile.

## Link to the hosted application.

HOW RAUXA REVIEW
---
Clarity: does the README clearly and concisely explains the problem and solution? Are technical tradeoffs explained?

Correctness: does the application do what was asked? If there is anything missing, does the README explain why it is missing?

Code quality: is the code simple, easy to understand, and maintainable? Are there any code smells or other red flags? Does object-oriented code follows principles such as the single responsibility principle? Is the coding style consistent with the language's guidelines? Is it consistent throughout the codebase?

Testing: how thorough are the automated tests? Will they be difficult to change if the requirements of the application were to change? Are there some unit and some integration tests? * We're not looking for full coverage (given time constraint) but just trying to get a feel for your testing skills.

UX: is the web interface understandable and pleasing to use?

Technical choices: do choices of libraries, architecture etc. seem appropriate for the chosen application?

Scalability (bonus): will technical choices scale well? If not, is there a discussion of those choices in the README?

Production-readiness (bonus): does the code include monitoring? Logging? Proper error handling?
